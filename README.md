# Motivation
To generate math questions on specific topics, skill sets, and difficulty levels.

## VerticalMultiplication
This module generates questions to practice vertical multiplication. The generated questions focus on error-prone cases, including:
- Involvement of carry-over.
- Involvement of double carry-over (where the carry-over contributes to the carry-over of the next higher position).
- Presence of zero(s) in the middle position.
- Presence of zero(s) at the end position.
