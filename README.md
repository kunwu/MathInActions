# Motivation
To generate math questions on specific topics, skill sets, and difficulty levels.

## VerticalMultiplication
This module generates questions to practice vertical multiplication. The generated questions focus on error-prone cases, including:
- Multiplication of a 4-digit number by a 3-digit number
- Involvement of carry-over
- Involvement of double carry-over (where the carry-over contributes to the carry-over of the next higher position)
- Presence of zero in the 4-digit number
